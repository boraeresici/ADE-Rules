- Create a standard template or boilerplate for microservices.
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for independent deployment of services.
- Use Kubernetes or similar orchestration tools for service discovery and load balancing.
- Define and implement an API versioning strategy.
- Regularly review and refactor service dependencies as needed.

**Rationale:** These practices streamline microservice development, deployment, and operation, ensuring consistency, automation, and efficient management of the distributed system.

**Automation Potential:** CI/CD platforms and orchestration tools automate these processes.
