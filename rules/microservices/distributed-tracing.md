# Rule: Distributed Tracing in Microservices

**Description:** This rule provides guidelines for implementing end-to-end visibility into requests as they flow across multiple services in a distributed system. It emphasizes the use of tools like OpenTelemetry to track the full lifecycle of a request, which is crucial for debugging, performance analysis, and understanding complex microservice interactions.

**Rationale:** In a distributed system, tracking the flow of a single request across numerous services can be extremely challenging. Distributed tracing provides a unified view of these interactions, enabling developers to quickly identify performance bottlenecks, error sources, and latency issues that would otherwise be difficult to diagnose. It is a fundamental component of effective observability in microservices.

### Core Principles:
- **Unique Correlation ID:** Assign a unique correlation ID to each incoming request at the edge of the system and propagate it across all services involved in processing that request.
- **Instrumentation:** Implement distributed tracing using industry-standard tools and libraries (e.g., OpenTelemetry) to instrument code and automatically capture span data.
- **Context Propagation:** Ensure that tracing context (including the correlation ID and parent span ID) is correctly propagated across service boundaries, typically via HTTP headers or message queue metadata.
- **Unified Observability:** Integrate tracing data with logging and metrics to provide a comprehensive observability strategy for microservices (referencing `logging-best-practices.md` and `metrics-implementation.md`).

### Good Practice:
```python
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.exporter.jaeger.thrift import JaegerExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import SERVICE_NAME, Resource
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor

# ... (OpenTelemetry setup as in original example)

tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

with tracer.start_as_current_span("get_user_workflow"):
    # Span for the overall workflow
    user = get_user_from_database(user_id) # This call would be instrumented too
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("process_user_data"):
        processed_user = process_user(user)
    # ... further calls to other services, also instrumented
```
*Example: Instrumenting a Python service with OpenTelemetry to create spans for different operations within a request.*

### Bad Practice:
```python
# Example: Logging service interactions without a correlation ID
# Service A logs: "Request received for user X"
# Service B logs: "Processing data for user X"
# Service C logs: "Database query for user X completed"
# Without a correlation ID, it's impossible to link these logs to a single end-to-end request.
```
*Example: Logging service interactions without propagating a unique correlation ID, making it impossible to trace a single request across multiple services.*

**Automation Potential:** OpenTelemetry SDKs and tracing platforms (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin) automate trace collection, context propagation, and visualization. CI/CD checks can ensure that services are properly instrumented for tracing.
