- Assign a unique correlation ID to each request.
- Implement distributed tracing using tools like OpenTelemetry.
- Design your logging and monitoring strategy to suit microservices architecture.

**Rationale:** In a distributed system, it's challenging to track the flow of a request across multiple services. Distributed tracing provides end-to-end visibility, crucial for debugging and performance analysis.

**Automation Potential:** OpenTelemetry SDKs and tracing platforms automate trace collection and visualization.

### Example (Distributed Tracing - Python):
```python
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.exporter.jaeger.thrift import JaegerExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import SERVICE_NAME, Resource
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor

resource = Resource(attributes={SERVICE_NAME: "user-service"})

jaeger_exporter = JaegerExporter(
    agent_host_name="localhost",
    agent_port=6831,
)

provider = TracerProvider(resource=resource)
provider.add_span_processor(BatchSpanProcessor(jaeger_exporter))
trace.set_tracer_provider(provider)

tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

with tracer.start_as_current_span("get_user"):
    # Business logic
    user = get_user_from_database(user_id)
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("process_user_data"):
        # Process user data
        processed_user = process_user(user)
```
