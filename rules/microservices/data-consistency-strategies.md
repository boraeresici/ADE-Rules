- Adopt an Eventual Consistency model.
- Manage distributed transactions using the Saga pattern.
- Separate read and write operations using the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern.

**Rationale:** Maintaining data consistency across multiple services is a challenge in microservices. Eventual consistency and patterns like Saga and CQRS provide strategies to handle this complexity.

**Automation Potential:** Event sourcing libraries and distributed transaction frameworks.
