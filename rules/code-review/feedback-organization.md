Organize feedback by priority:
1. Critical issues (must be fixed)
2. Warnings (recommended to fix)
3. Suggestions (can be considered for improvement)

**Rationale:** Prioritizing feedback helps the author focus on the most important issues first, streamlining the correction process and ensuring critical problems are addressed promptly.
