- Profile before optimizing.
- Use appropriate data structures.
- Minimize memory allocations.
- Perform operations in batches when possible.
- Implement caching strategically.
- Monitor performance metrics.
- Use lazy loading.
- Optimize critical paths first.

**Rationale:** These practices provide a holistic approach to performance optimization, ensuring that efforts are targeted, effective, and measurable.

**Automation Potential:** APM tools, logging, and monitoring systems track these metrics.
