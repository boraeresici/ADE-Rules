- Manage background tasks with asynchronous operations and queue systems (RabbitMQ, Kafka).
- Implement load balancing and auto-scaling strategies.
- Scale system components independently using microservices architecture.

**Rationale:** Scalability ensures that the application can handle increasing user loads and data volumes without degradation in performance. Asynchronous processing and microservices enable horizontal scaling.

**Automation Potential:** Cloud platforms provide managed load balancers and auto-scaling groups. Container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes) automates microservice scaling.
