- Use parallel processing and concurrent programming techniques.
- Implement controlled concurrency.

**Rationale:** Asynchronous and parallel processing can significantly improve throughput and responsiveness for I/O-bound or CPU-bound tasks by utilizing available resources more effectively. Controlled concurrency prevents resource exhaustion.

**Automation Potential:** Language-specific concurrency primitives (e.g., Go goroutines, Python asyncio) and frameworks.

### Example (Parallel Processing):
```javascript
async function fetchMultipleUrls(urls) {
    // Good: Parallel processing
    const results = await Promise.all(
        urls.map(url => fetch(url))
    );

    // Better: Controlled concurrency
    const concurrencyLimit = 5;
    const results = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < urls.length; i += concurrencyLimit) {
        const batch = urls.slice(i, i + concurrencyLimit);
        const batchResults = await Promise.all(
            batch.map(url => fetch(url))
        );
        results.push(...batchResults);
    }

    return results;
}
```
