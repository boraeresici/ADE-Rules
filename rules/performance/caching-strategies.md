- Implement multi-level caching (in-memory, distributed cache).
- Effectively use caching mechanisms (Redis, Memcached).
- Implement cache eviction strategies like LRU (Least Recently Used).

**Rationale:** Caching reduces the need to recompute or refetch data, significantly improving response times and reducing load on backend systems. Multi-level caching optimizes for different access patterns.

**Automation Potential:** Caching libraries and services automate cache management.
