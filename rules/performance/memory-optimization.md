- Use object pooling techniques.
- Implement memory-efficient patterns (generators, etc.).

**Rationale:** Efficient memory usage reduces garbage collection overhead, improves cache hit rates, and can prevent out-of-memory errors, especially in resource-constrained environments.

**Automation Potential:** Memory profiling tools can identify memory leaks and inefficient allocations.
