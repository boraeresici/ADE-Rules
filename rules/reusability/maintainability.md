# Rule: Code Maintainability

**Description:** This rule outlines essential practices to ensure that code is easy to understand, modify, and extend throughout its entire lifecycle. It focuses on strategies that reduce complexity, improve readability, and facilitate future development and maintenance efforts.

**Rationale:** Code maintainability is crucial for the long-term success of any software project. Unmaintainable code leads to increased development costs, slower feature delivery, higher bug rates, and developer frustration. By adhering to practices that promote maintainability, teams can ensure that the codebase remains adaptable, resilient, and easy to work with over time, preventing code rot and technical debt accumulation.

### Core Principles:
- **Gradual Refactoring:** Regularly refactor legacy or complex code, making small, incremental improvements rather than attempting large, risky overhauls (referencing `refactoring.md`).
- **Up-to-Date Documentation:** Keep code documentation, including inline comments, API documentation, and architectural diagrams, accurate and up-to-date.
- **Regular Code Reviews:** Conduct regular and thorough code reviews to ensure adherence to coding standards, identify potential issues, and share knowledge among team members.
- **Technical Debt Management:** Proactively track and address technical debt in a timely manner, prioritizing items that significantly impact maintainability or future development.
- **Clear Code Structure:** Organize code into logical, well-defined modules and components with clear responsibilities (referencing `srp.md`).

### Good Practice:
```python
# Good: A well-documented function with clear intent
def calculate_total_order_price(items, tax_rate, discount_code=None):
    """Calculates the total price of an order including tax and optional discount.

    Args:
        items (list): List of item dictionaries, each with 'price' and 'quantity'.
        tax_rate (float): The tax rate to apply (e.g., 0.05 for 5%).
        discount_code (str, optional): An optional discount code.

    Returns:
        float: The total price of the order.
    """
    subtotal = sum(item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in items)
    tax_amount = subtotal * tax_rate
    total = subtotal + tax_amount

    if discount_code == "SAVE10":
        total *= 0.90 # Apply 10% discount

    return total
```

### Bad Practice:
```python
# Bad: A complex, undocumented function with unclear variable names
def c(i, t, d=None):
    s = sum(x['p'] * x['q'] for x in i)
    tx = s * t
    tot = s + tx
    if d == "S10":
        tot *= 0.90
    return tot
```

**Automation Potential:** Static analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube) can measure maintainability index, cyclomatic complexity, and code duplication. Code review tools facilitate the review process. CI/CD checks can enforce documentation standards. Automated tests ensure that refactoring does not break existing functionality.
