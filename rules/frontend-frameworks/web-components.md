### Custom Elements
- Define custom elements using `customElements.define()`.
- Extend from `HTMLElement`.
- Use a hyphen in custom element names (e.g., `<my-component>`).

**Rationale:** Custom Elements allow you to create new HTML tags with custom behavior, encapsulating functionality and improving reusability across different frameworks or no framework at all.

### Shadow DOM
- Use Shadow DOM for style and markup encapsulation.
- Understand the difference between open and closed shadow roots.

**Rationale:** Shadow DOM provides strong encapsulation, preventing styles and scripts from leaking in or out of the component, ensuring predictable rendering.

### HTML Templates
- Use `<template>` and `<slot>` elements for declarative component structure and content distribution.

**Rationale:** HTML Templates allow you to define reusable markup structures that are not rendered until activated, improving performance and maintainability.

### Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML within your custom elements.
- Ensure keyboard navigation.
- Provide ARIA attributes where necessary.

**Rationale:** Accessible Web Components are crucial for building inclusive web applications.

### Interoperability
- Web Components are framework-agnostic and can be used with React, Vue, Angular, or vanilla JavaScript.
- Use custom events for communication between components.

**Rationale:** Web Components provide a native browser standard for componentization, ensuring long-term compatibility and broad interoperability.

### Testing
- Write unit tests for custom elements.
- Write integration tests for component interactions.

**Rationale:** Comprehensive testing ensures component reliability and prevents regressions.
