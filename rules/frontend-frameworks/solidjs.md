### Reactivity Model
- Understand Solid's fine-grained reactivity using `createSignal`, `createEffect`, `createMemo`.
- Avoid re-rendering components; Solid updates the DOM directly.
- Use stores for global state management.

**Rationale:** SolidJS offers a unique reactivity model that updates the DOM directly without a virtual DOM, leading to extremely high performance and efficient updates.

### Component Design
- Use JSX for templating.
- Keep components small and focused.
- Understand the difference between props and signals.

**Rationale:** Solid's component model is familiar to React developers but leverages its reactivity system for superior performance.

### Performance Optimization
- SolidJS is inherently performant due to its compilation and reactivity model.
- Focus on efficient data structures and algorithms.
- Optimize asset loading.

**Rationale:** Solid's design minimizes runtime overhead, making it one of the fastest frontend frameworks.

### Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML.
- Ensure keyboard navigation.
- Provide ARIA attributes where necessary.

**Rationale:** Accessible applications cater to a broader audience and improve overall usability.

### Testing
- Write unit tests for components and reactive primitives.
- Write end-to-end tests for critical user flows.

**Rationale:** Comprehensive testing ensures application reliability and prevents regressions.
