# Rule: Refactoring

**Description:** Regularly refactor code to improve its structure, readability, and performance without changing its external behavior. Address technical debt proactively.

**Rationale:** Codebases evolve, and what was a good solution yesterday might not be optimal today. Refactoring prevents code decay and keeps the system healthy.

**Good Practice:**
```python
# Before Refactoring (Example: large function)
def process_order(order_id, customer_id, items, payment_info):
    # Validate order
    # Calculate total
    # Process payment
    # Update inventory
    # Send confirmation email
    pass

# After Refactoring (Example: smaller, focused functions)
def validate_order(order_id, customer_id, items):
    pass
def calculate_order_total(items):
    pass
def process_payment(payment_info):
    pass
def update_inventory(items):
    pass
def send_confirmation_email(customer_id, order_id):
    pass

def process_order_refactored(order_id, customer_id, items, payment_info):
    validate_order(order_id, customer_id, items)
    total = calculate_order_total(items)
    process_payment(payment_info)
    update_inventory(items)
    send_confirmation_email(customer_id, order_id)
```

**Bad Practice:**
```python
# Avoiding refactoring leads to:
# - Large, complex functions (God Objects)
# - Duplicate code across the codebase
# - Code that is hard to test and debug
# - Increased technical debt
# - Slower development cycles
```

**Automation Potential:** Static analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube) can identify code smells that indicate a need for refactoring (e.g., long methods, high cyclomatic complexity). IDEs offer automated refactoring tools. Code reviews are essential for strategic refactoring decisions.
