- Regularly measure code quality metrics (cyclomatic complexity, maintainability index).
- Use static code analysis tools (SonarQube, ESLint) and address warnings.
- Perform performance profiling and identify bottlenecks.
- Conduct regular code reviews and share best practices.

**Rationale:** High code quality is foundational for maintainable and reliable systems. Regular analysis helps identify and rectify issues early, reducing technical debt and improving overall system health.

**Automation Potential:** Static analysis tools and code quality platforms automate metric collection and reporting.
