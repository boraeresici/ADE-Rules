# Rule: Distributed Tracing

**Description:** This rule provides guidelines for implementing end-to-end visibility into requests as they traverse complex microservices architectures. It emphasizes the use of vendor-agnostic tools like OpenTelemetry to track the full lifecycle of a request, which is crucial for debugging, performance analysis, and understanding service interactions in distributed systems.

**Rationale:** In a distributed system, tracking the flow of a single request across numerous services can be extremely challenging. Distributed tracing provides a unified view of these interactions, enabling developers to quickly identify performance bottlenecks, error sources, and latency issues that would otherwise be difficult to diagnose. It is a fundamental component of effective observability.

### Core Principles:
- **Vendor-Agnostic Instrumentation:** Implement distributed tracing using vendor-agnostic tools like OpenTelemetry to ensure flexibility and avoid vendor lock-in.
- **Span Creation:** Add spans for critical operations within each service, capturing relevant context and attributes.
- **Context Propagation:** Ensure that tracing context (including trace ID and span ID) is correctly propagated across service boundaries, typically via HTTP headers or message queue metadata.
- **Sampling:** Implement appropriate sampling strategies to manage the volume of trace data without losing critical insights.
- **Correlation with Logs & Metrics:** Correlate traces with logs and metrics to provide a comprehensive view of system behavior (referencing `logging-best-practices.md` and `metrics-implementation.md`).

### Good Practice:
```python
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import ConsoleSpanExporter, SimpleSpanProcessor

# Configure tracer (simplified for example)
provider = TracerProvider()
provider.add_span_processor(SimpleSpanProcessor(ConsoleSpanExporter()))
trace.set_tracer_provider(provider)

tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

with tracer.start_as_current_span("process_order"):
    # Simulate calling another service
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("call_payment_service"):
        # ... logic to call payment service ...
        pass
    # ... further processing ...
```
*Example: Instrumenting a Python service with OpenTelemetry to create spans for different operations.*

### Bad Practice:
```python
# Example: Logging service interactions without a correlation ID or tracing context
# Service A logs: "Request received for order 123"
# Service B logs: "Processing order 123"
# Service C logs: "Database update for order 123"
# Without distributed tracing, linking these logs to a single end-to-end request is manual and error-prone.
```
*Example: Relying solely on logs without distributed tracing, making it difficult to understand the full path and latency of a request across services.*

**Automation Potential:** OpenTelemetry SDKs and tracing platforms (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin) automate trace collection, context propagation, and visualization. CI/CD checks can ensure that services are properly instrumented for tracing.
