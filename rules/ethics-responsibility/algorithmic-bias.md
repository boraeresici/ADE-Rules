1.  **Data Diversity**: Ensure your training data is diverse and representative.
2.  **Regular Audits**: Regularly audit your algorithm's outputs for bias.
3.  **Diversity-Focused Team**: Build a diverse development team that represents different perspectives.
4.  **Bias Mitigation Techniques**: Use bias mitigation techniques in data preprocessing and model design.
5.  **Human Oversight**: Establish mechanisms for human oversight and intervention in critical decisions.

**Rationale:** Algorithmic bias can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. Addressing bias is crucial for building equitable and trustworthy AI systems.

**Automation Potential:** Bias detection tools and fairness metrics in machine learning libraries.

### Example (Simple Bias Check):
```python
def check_gender_bias(model_predictions, actual_outcomes, gender_data):
    male_accuracy = sum([p == a for p, a, g in zip(model_predictions, actual_outcomes, gender_data) if g == 'male']) / gender_data.count('male')
    female_accuracy = sum([p == a for p, a, g in zip(model_predictions, actual_outcomes, gender_data) if g == 'female']) / gender_data.count('female')

    bias = abs(male_accuracy - female_accuracy)
    return bias < 0.05  # 5% tolerance

# Usage
predictions = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
actuals = [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
genders = ['male', 'female', 'male', 'female', 'female', 'male', 'female', 'male']

if check_gender_bias(predictions, actuals, genders):
    print("No significant gender bias detected.")
else:
    print("Potential gender bias detected. Further investigation needed.")
```
