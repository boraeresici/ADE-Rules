1.  **Energy Efficiency**: Optimize the software's energy consumption.
2.  **Resource Optimization**: Efficiently use server and storage resources.
3.  **Green Hosting**: Prefer hosting providers that use renewable energy.
4.  **Long-Term Design**: Design software for long-term use, preventing frequent rewrites.
5.  **E-Waste Management**: Reduce e-waste by optimizing software's hardware requirements.

**Rationale:** Software development has an environmental impact. Sustainable practices reduce energy consumption, minimize resource waste, and contribute to a greener future.

**Automation Potential:** Cloud cost management tools, performance monitoring, and green coding practices.

### Example (Energy Efficiency Check):
```python
import time
import psutil

def measure_energy_usage(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        start_energy = psutil.cpu_percent(interval=None)

        result = func(*args, **kwargs)

        end_time = time.time()
        end_energy = psutil.cpu_percent(interval=None)

        duration = end_time - start_time
        energy_usage = end_energy - start_energy

        print(f"Function {func.__name__} took {duration:.2f} seconds and used {energy_usage:.2f}% CPU.")
        return result
    return wrapper

# Usage
@measure_energy_usage
def some_heavy_computation():
    # Simulate heavy computation
    for _ in range(10000000):
        pass

some_heavy_computation()
```
