1.  **Transparency**: Be open with users about how the system works and how decisions are made.
2.  **Fair Use**: Ensure the system treats all users equally and fairly.
3.  **Do No Harm**: Evaluate and minimize the potential harms of the system you develop.
4.  **User Consent**: Obtain informed consent from users on how their data will be used.
5.  **Accountability**: Take responsibility for the system's decisions and outcomes.

**Rationale:** Ethical considerations are paramount in software development to build trust, protect users, and ensure technology serves the greater good. Transparency and fairness are foundational.

**Automation Potential:** While ethical decision-making is largely human, tools can assist in auditing for fairness and transparency (e.g., explainable AI tools).

### Example (Ethical Decision-Making Process):
```python
def ethical_decision(action, impact_assessment):
    if impact_assessment['harm'] > impact_assessment['benefit']:
        return False
    if not impact_assessment['user_consent']:
        return False
    if not impact_assessment['explainable']:
        return False
    return True

# Usage
action = "user_data_collection"
impact = {
    'harm': 2,
    'benefit': 8,
    'user_consent': True,
    'explainable': True
}

if ethical_decision(action, impact):
    print("Action is ethical, proceed.")
else:
    print("Action is not ethical, reconsider.")
```
