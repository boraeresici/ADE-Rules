**Description:** All code, especially APIs, should be accompanied by clear and comprehensive documentation. This includes README files, code comments, and changelogs.

**Rationale:** Good documentation reduces the learning curve, improves maintainability, and allows developers and users to understand and use the system effectively. Up-to-date documentation prevents confusion and errors.

**Good Practice:**
- Provide clear documentation for every API endpoint (e.g., using OpenAPI/Swagger).
- Add comments to explain complex or non-obvious code blocks.
- Maintain a README with the project's purpose, setup steps, and usage examples.
- Keep a meaningful changelog for each version.
