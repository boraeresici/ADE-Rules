**Description:** Use consistent terminology, formatting, and writing style across all documentation and UI components. For example, use sentence case everywhere except for specific elements like buttons.

**Rationale:** Consistency makes the application and its documentation predictable and easier to navigate. It reduces cognitive load and reinforces a professional, polished user experience.

**Good Practice:**
- Define a style guide for documentation and UI text.
- Use the same term for the same concept everywhere (e.g., always "Cluster," not "Instance" or "Node" interchangeably).
- Maintain consistent capitalization and punctuation.
