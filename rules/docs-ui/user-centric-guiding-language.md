**Description:** Use language that is centered on the user's perspective. Error messages should be helpful and guide the user toward a solution. Avoid vague or technical jargon where possible.

**Rationale:** Empathetic and helpful communication, especially during errors, improves user satisfaction and reduces frustration. It makes the application feel more reliable and user-friendly.

**Good Practice:**
- Write error messages that explain what went wrong and how to fix it.
- Use positive and encouraging language.
- Avoid assuming deep technical knowledge; provide explanations or links where necessary.
