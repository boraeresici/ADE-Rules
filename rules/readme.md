# ADE Rules - Structured for AI/ADE Consumption

This repository contains Application Development Environment (ADE) Rules, designed to establish standards for quality, security, performance, and teamwork in software development processes. These rules aim to create a more sustainable and efficient working environment.

## Purpose and Structure

This repository is hosted on GitHub: [https://github.com/boraeresici/ADE-Rules](https://github.com/boraeresici/ADE-Rules)

The rules are organized into a modular, granular structure to facilitate consumption by both human developers and automated systems like AI Development Environments (ADEs) or Command-Line Interfaces (CLIs).

Each rule category resides in its own directory (e.g., `code-quality/`, `security/`). Within each category directory, you will find:

1.  **Individual Rule Files (`.md`):** Each specific rule is defined in its own Markdown file. This adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle, making each rule atomic, easy to understand, and independently applicable.
    *   Each rule file includes YAML frontmatter for metadata (ID, title, description, tags) and structured Markdown content detailing the rule, its rationale, good/bad practices, and examples.

2.  **Manifest File (`rules.json`):** A JSON file that acts as a manifest for all rules within that category. It lists each rule with its metadata and a pointer to its corresponding Markdown documentation file.

**Example Directory Structure:**

```
rules/
├── code-quality/
│   ├── rules.json
│   ├── readability-clarity.md
│   └── simplicity-kiss.md
├── security/
│   ├── rules.json
│   ├── never-trust-user-input.md
│   └── least-privilege.md
└── ... (other categories)
```

**Example `rules.json` Content:**

```json
[
  {
    "id": "readability-clarity",
    "name": "Readability and Clarity",
    "description": "Code should be written to be easily understandable by other developers.",
    "documentation": "readability-clarity.md",
    "tags": ["code-quality", "readability", "clean-code"]
  },
  // ... other rules in this category
]
```

## Usage for ADEs/CLIs

This structured format is ideal for automated systems:

*   **Rule Discovery:** An ADE can easily discover all available rules by iterating through the category directories and reading their respective `rules.json` files. This allows for programmatic access to rule metadata (ID, name, description, tags).
*   **Detailed Rule Retrieval:** Once a rule is identified (e.g., by its ID or tags), the ADE can retrieve its full documentation by reading the `.md` file specified in the `documentation` field of the `rules.json` entry.
*   **Targeted Application:** The granular nature of the rules allows ADEs to apply very specific guidelines to particular code contexts, leading to more precise and effective suggestions.

## Goals

-   **Increase Code Quality:** Encourage writing readable, maintainable, and less error-prone code.
-   **Reduce Security Risks:** Detect and prevent security vulnerabilities at an early stage.
-   **Optimize Performance:** Ensure applications run faster and more efficiently.
-   **Improve Development Processes:** Standardize processes such as version control, testing, and documentation.
-   **Ensure Team Cohesion:** Increase team efficiency by enabling different developers to work with the same standards.

## Areas of Use

-   **Code Review:** Can be used as a checklist for code review processes.
-   **IDE Integration:** Can be integrated into the development environment to provide instant feedback to developers.
-   **CI/CD Pipelines:** These rules can be used as a basis for automated testing and auditing steps.
-   **Orientation for New Team Members:** Can serve as a resource for quickly learning project standards and expectations.

## Customization

These rules can be customized and extended according to the needs of the project and the team. They have a flexible structure and aim to provide a framework rather than a "one-size-fits-all" solution.
