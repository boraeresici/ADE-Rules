**Description:** Implement a fully automated CI/CD pipeline for building, testing, and deploying applications. Workflows should be organized, reusable, and secure.

**Rationale:** CI/CD automation ensures rapid, reliable, and consistent software delivery. It reduces manual error and accelerates the feedback loop for developers.

**Good Practice:**
- Organize workflows by purpose (e.g., `ci.yml`, `deploy.yml`).
- Use reusable workflows or composite actions to avoid repetition (DRY).
- Pin Action versions to specific commits or tags for security.
- Use OIDC for secure authentication to cloud providers.
