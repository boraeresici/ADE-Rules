**Description:** Integrate logging and monitoring tools to gain visibility into application performance and health. Create regular backup and disaster recovery plans.

**Rationale:** Robust logging and monitoring are critical for operational stability, debugging, and security. A solid backup and DR plan is essential for business continuity.

**Good Practice:**
- Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, or the ELK stack.
- Log structured data (e.g., JSON) for easier analysis.
- Create alerts for critical error patterns and performance degradation.
