**Note:** This rule extends the foundational principles defined in the `observability` category. Ensure that `metrics-implementation` and `logging-best-practices` are already in place.

### Core AI-Specific Metrics:
- **Model Drift:**
  - **Data Drift:** Monitor input data distributions to detect shifts from the training data.
  - **Concept Drift:** Monitor the relationship between input and output to detect changes in the underlying problem.
- **Model Performance:**
  - **Prediction Confidence Scores:** Track the confidence levels of model outputs.
  - **Accuracy/Precision/Recall:** Track core ML performance metrics over time.
- **Operational & Cost Metrics:**
  - **Token Usage:** For LLMs, track input/output token counts.
  - **Cost per Task/Inference:** Monitor the financial cost of model usage.
- **Fairness & Bias:**
  - Implement metrics to detect and alert on algorithmic bias across different user segments.

### Production Checklist:
- [ ] Foundational system metrics (latency, errors per `metrics-implementation`) are collected.
- [ ] Drift detection (data & concept drift) is configured using tools like MLflow or WhyLogs.
- [ ] AI-specific dashboards (showing drift, confidence scores, etc.) are visible to ML and Ops teams.
- [ ] Alerts are configured for significant drift, drops in accuracy, or unexpected bias detection.
