**Note:** This rule is a practical application of the ethical principles outlined in `ethical-software-development.md`, particularly concerning accountability and fairness in AI systems.

### Core Principles for Human-in-the-Loop:
- **Threshold Definition:** Define clear thresholds where human review is mandatory:
  - AI confidence score below a defined percentage (e.g., < X%).
  - Actions involving high-risk domains (financial transactions, medical diagnoses, legal advice).
  - Requests that are out-of-policy or potentially harmful (referencing `guardrails.md`).
- **Operator Override & Logging:** Implement mechanisms for operators to **log overrides** with detailed reason codes, ensuring accountability and auditability.
- **Audit Trail:** Maintain a comprehensive audit trail for all human reviews and overrides.

### Production Checklist:
- [ ] Confidence thresholds for human review are clearly defined and enforced.  
- [ ] Human review is mandated for high-risk AI outputs (financial, medical, legal, etc.).  
- [ ] All override decisions by human operators are logged with specific reason codes.  
- [ ] A robust audit trail for all human interventions in AI decisions is maintained.
