**Description:** Adopt a comprehensive testing strategy that includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end (E2E) tests. Strive for high test coverage and explicitly write tests for error scenarios.

**Rationale:** A multi-layered testing approach ensures quality at every level. Unit tests verify individual components, integration tests ensure they work together, and E2E tests validate complete user workflows. Testing error paths is critical for building robust applications.

**Good Practice:**
- Write unit tests for every new feature or bug fix.
- Adopt a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach where appropriate.
- Use CI/CD pipelines to run all tests automatically on every commit.
- Use tools to measure and track test coverage.
