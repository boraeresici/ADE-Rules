**Description:** For distributed systems, implement strategies to recover from transient failures. This includes retry logic (with exponential backoff) and the circuit breaker pattern.

**Rationale:** Network requests and external service calls can fail intermittently. Recovery strategies enhance system resilience by automatically handling these transient issues, preventing a single component failure from cascading through the system.

**Good Practice:**
- Use a library like `axios-retry` or `resilience4j` to implement retries.
- Implement a circuit breaker to stop sending requests to a service that is known to be failing.
