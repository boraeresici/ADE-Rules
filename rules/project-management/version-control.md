- Write meaningful commit messages for Git.
- Use the feature branch approach.
- Conduct detailed reviews for pull requests.
- Implement branch protection rules.

**Rationale:** Effective version control is fundamental for collaborative software development. Meaningful commit messages aid in understanding changes, feature branching isolates work, and pull requests ensure code quality and knowledge sharing. Branch protection prevents accidental or unauthorized changes to critical branches.

**Automation Potential:** Git hooks can enforce commit message formats. CI/CD pipelines can automate pull request checks.
