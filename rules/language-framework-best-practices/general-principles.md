- Follow official documentation and community-accepted best practices for each language and framework.
- Prioritize code readability and maintainability.
- Implement language and framework-specific security best practices.
- Consider performance optimizations, but avoid premature optimization.
- Use language-specific standard tools for version control and package management.

**Rationale:** Adhering to these general principles ensures that development efforts are aligned with industry standards, leading to higher quality, more secure, and more efficient software.

**Automation Potential:** Many of these are cultural or design principles, but tools can support their implementation.
