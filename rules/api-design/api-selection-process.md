A structured process ensures that the chosen API type and its implementation align with project goals, performance requirements, and future maintainability.

### 1. Analyze Project Requirements
- Data structure complexity.
- Performance needs.
- Client diversity (web, mobile, IoT, etc.).
- Scalability requirements.

### 2. Determine Use Cases
- CRUD operations.
- Real-time updates.
- Batch data processing.

### 3. Choose API Type
- Choose between RESTful API, GraphQL, or gRPC.
- Use a hybrid approach if necessary (e.g., REST + GraphQL).

### 4. Design the API
- Design endpoints or schema.
- Create data models.
- Plan security measures.

### 5. Create Documentation
- Prepare API reference documents (e.g., Swagger, GraphQL Playground).
- Write usage examples and integration guides.

### 6. Test and Iterate
- Write unit and integration tests.
- Perform performance tests.
- Revise design if necessary.

### 7. Define Versioning and Maintenance Strategy
- Choose an API versioning approach (URL, header, etc.).
- Create a backward compatibility policy.
- Plan API lifecycle management.

**Automation Potential:** API design tools can assist in schema definition and validation.
