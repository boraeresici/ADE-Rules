### Focus Areas
- React component architecture (hooks, context, performance)
- Responsive CSS with Tailwind/CSS-in-JS
- State management (Redux, Zustand, Context API)
- Frontend performance (lazy loading, code splitting, memoization)
- Accessibility (WCAG compliance, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

**Rationale:** These focus areas represent critical aspects of modern UI/UX development, directly impacting user satisfaction, application performance, and long-term maintainability.

### Approach
1. Component-oriented thinking - reusable, composable UI pieces
2. Mobile-first responsive design
3. Performance budgets - aim for load times under 3 seconds
4. Semantic HTML and appropriate ARIA attributes
5. Type safety with TypeScript when appropriate

**Rationale:** A structured approach ensures consistency, scalability, and adherence to best practices from the outset of development.
