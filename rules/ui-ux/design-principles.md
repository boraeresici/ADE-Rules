- Create and implement a consistent design system (color palette, typography, components).
- Apply responsive design principles, adapting to different devices and screen sizes.
- Comply with accessibility standards (WCAG), ensuring screen reader compatibility.
- Adopt a user-centered design approach, conducting user research and testing.
- Use micro-interactions and animations judiciously and meaningfully.
- Create and keep design system documentation up-to-date.
- Establish a flexible CSS structure for dark mode and theme support.

**Rationale:** A strong design system and user-centered principles lead to intuitive, consistent, and inclusive user experiences. Accessibility ensures the application is usable by everyone.

**Automation Potential:** Design system tools can help maintain consistency. Accessibility checkers can identify WCAG violations.
