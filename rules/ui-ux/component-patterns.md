- Use compound components for related UI elements.
- Implement render props for flexible component APIs.
- Use custom hooks to extract and reuse component logic.
- Follow the container/presentational component pattern when appropriate.
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility.

**Rationale:** Design patterns promote reusable, flexible, and maintainable components, improving code quality and development efficiency.
