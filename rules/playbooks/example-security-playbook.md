# Rule: Example Security Incident Playbook

**Description:** This playbook provides a structured, step-by-step guide for responding to a common security incident, such as a detected SQL Injection attempt or a compromised credential. It is designed to be executable by an ADE, guiding the agent through detection, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident analysis phases.

**Rationale:** Security incidents require rapid and consistent responses to minimize impact. Playbooks provide a predefined set of actions, ensuring that critical steps are not missed and response times are optimized. Automating parts of the playbook through ADEs further accelerates response and reduces human error.

### Detection Phase:
1.  **Alert Trigger:** SIEM system detects anomalous activity (e.g., multiple failed logins, unusual database queries).
2.  **Initial Triage:** ADE checks alert details, affected systems, and user context.

### Containment Phase:
1.  **Isolate Affected Systems:** ADE triggers network isolation for compromised hosts or blocks suspicious IP addresses.
2.  **Revoke Credentials:** ADE initiates revocation of potentially compromised user or service credentials.

### Eradication Phase:
1.  **Identify Root Cause:** Manual investigation or ADE-assisted log analysis to pinpoint the vulnerability.
2.  **Patch/Remediate:** ADE suggests or applies patches to vulnerable systems.

### Recovery Phase:
1.  **Restore Services:** ADE brings isolated systems back online after remediation.
2.  **Verify Integrity:** ADE runs automated checks to ensure system integrity and functionality.

### Post-Incident Analysis:
1.  **Generate Report:** ADE compiles incident timeline, actions taken, and lessons learned.
2.  **Update Playbook:** ADE suggests updates to this playbook or related rules based on findings.

**Automation Potential:** Many steps in this playbook (e.g., isolation, credential revocation, log analysis, patching) can be partially or fully automated by ADEs integrated with security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) platforms.
