**Description:** Integrate automated security scanning into the CI/CD pipeline. This includes scanning for vulnerable dependencies (SCA), static code analysis (SAST), and dynamic analysis (DAST).

**Rationale:** Manual security reviews do not scale. Automating vulnerability detection provides rapid feedback to developers and ensures that known vulnerabilities are caught before they reach production.

**Good Practice:**
- Use tools like Snyk, Dependabot, or OWASP ZAP in the CI pipeline.
- Regularly update all third-party dependencies.
- Fail the build if critical vulnerabilities are detected.
