# Rule: Automate Vulnerability Management

**Description:** This rule mandates the integration of automated security scanning tools, including Software Composition Analysis (SCA), Static Application Security Testing (SAST), and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), directly into the CI/CD pipeline. The goal is to detect and address security defects as early as possible in the development lifecycle.

**Rationale:** Manual security reviews are often slow, error-prone, and do not scale with modern development practices. Automating vulnerability detection provides rapid feedback to developers, ensures that known vulnerabilities are identified and remediated before reaching production, and significantly reduces the cost and effort of fixing security issues.

### Good Practice:
```yaml
# Example: CI/CD pipeline step for automated security scanning
jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Run Snyk vulnerability scan
      uses: snyk/actions/node@master
      env:
        SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
      with:
        command: test
    - name: Run SAST tool (e.g., SonarQube analysis)
      run: | 
        # ... SonarQube scanner command ...
    - name: Run DAST tool (e.g., OWASP ZAP scan)
      run: | 
        # ... OWASP ZAP scan command ...
```

### Bad Practice:
```yaml
# Example: Security scanning only performed manually or late in the development cycle
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Deploy to production
      run: | 
        # ... deployment commands ...
# No automated security checks before deployment, relying solely on manual audits.
```

**Automation Potential:** SCA tools (e.g., Snyk, Dependabot) automatically identify vulnerable dependencies. SAST tools (e.g., SonarQube, Checkmarx) analyze source code for security flaws. DAST tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) test running applications for vulnerabilities. CI/CD platforms automate the execution of these tools.
