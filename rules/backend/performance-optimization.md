- Implement caching strategies (Redis, Memcached).
- Use asynchronous processing and message queues.
- Optimize database queries.
- Consider using CDN.
- Implement lazy loading and pagination techniques.

**Rationale:** Performance optimization is critical for user satisfaction and system efficiency. Caching reduces latency, and asynchronous processing improves throughput.

**Automation Potential:** Caching libraries and services automate cache management. Performance monitoring tools track and identify bottlenecks.
