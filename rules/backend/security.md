# Rule: Backend Security

**Description:** This rule outlines essential security practices for protecting sensitive data, preventing unauthorized access, and mitigating common vulnerabilities in backend systems. It emphasizes a multi-layered approach to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of your application.

**Rationale:** Backend security is paramount as it often handles sensitive user data, critical business logic, and access to databases. A robust security posture is crucial to protect against data breaches, service disruptions, and reputational damage. Implementing these practices helps build trust and comply with regulatory requirements.

### Core Principles:
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., MFA, secure password policies) and granular authorization controls (e.g., RBAC) to verify user identities and control access to resources (referencing `strong-auth-crypto.md`).
- **Secure Communication:** Enforce HTTPS for all communication and ensure SSL/TLS certificates are up-to-date and properly configured.
- **Input Validation & Sanitization:** Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQLi, XSS) and other forms of malicious input (referencing `never-trust-user-input.md`).
- **Rate Limiting & Throttling:** Add rate limiting and throttling mechanisms to protect against brute-force attacks, denial-of-service (DoS), and API abuse.
- **Vulnerability Management:** Conduct regular security scans (SAST, DAST) and penetration testing to identify and remediate vulnerabilities proactively (referencing `automate-vulnerability-management.md`).

### Good Practice:
```python
# Example of input validation and sanitization in a Python API
from flask import request, jsonify
from html import escape

@app.route('/api/v1/comments', methods=['POST'])
def add_comment():
    data = request.get_json()
    if not data or 'text' not in data:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Missing comment text'}), 400

    comment_text = escape(data['text']) # Sanitize input
    # ... save comment_text to database ...
    return jsonify({'message': 'Comment added', 'text': comment_text}), 201
```

### Bad Practice:
```python
# Example of vulnerable code due to lack of input sanitization
from flask import request, jsonify

@app.route('/api/v1/search', methods=['GET'])
def search_products():
    query = request.args.get('q')
    # Directly using user input in a database query without sanitization
    # Vulnerable to SQL Injection if query is malicious
    # products = db.execute(f"SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%{query}%'")
    return jsonify({'results': []}), 200
```

**Automation Potential:** SAST (Static Application Security Testing) and DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) tools can identify common vulnerabilities. Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) can provide real-time protection against known attack patterns. Code reviews are critical for identifying logical flaws and architectural security issues.
