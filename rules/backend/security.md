- Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Use HTTPS and keep SSL/TLS certificates up-to-date.
- Implement input validation and sanitization.
- Add rate limiting and throttling mechanisms.
- Conduct regular scans for vulnerabilities.

**Rationale:** Backend security is paramount for protecting sensitive data and preventing unauthorized access. A multi-layered approach covering authentication, authorization, input handling, and threat mitigation is essential.

**Automation Potential:** Security frameworks, WAFs, and vulnerability scanners assist in enforcing these practices.
