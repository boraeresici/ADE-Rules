# Rule: Backend Fundamentals

**Description:** This rule outlines the core focus areas and a structured approach for designing and implementing robust, scalable, and secure backend architectures. It emphasizes foundational principles that directly impact data integrity, system performance, security, and maintainability.

**Rationale:** A strong understanding and consistent application of backend fundamentals are crucial for building reliable and extensible systems. A structured approach ensures that the backend is well-organized, capable of meeting current and future demands, and reduces technical debt.

### Core Principles:
- **RESTful API Design:** Design APIs with appropriate versioning and error handling (referencing `restful-api-design.md`).
- **Service Architecture:** Clearly define service boundaries and inter-service communication strategies (referencing `service-architecture.md`).
- **Database Design:** Implement robust database schema design, including normalization, indexing, and sharding (referencing `database-design.md`).
- **Performance Optimization:** Apply caching strategies and other techniques for performance optimization (referencing `performance-optimization.md`).
- **Security Patterns:** Integrate basic security patterns such as authentication and rate limiting (referencing `security.md`).

### Good Practice:
```python
# Example of a well-defined API endpoint following REST principles
@app.route('/api/v1/users/<int:user_id>', methods=['GET'])
def get_user(user_id):
    user = User.query.get(user_id)
    if user:
        return jsonify(user.to_dict()), 200
    return jsonify({'message': 'User not found'}), 404
```

### Bad Practice:
```python
# Example of a poorly designed API endpoint (e.g., using GET for state change, unclear resource)
@app.route('/api/v1/updateUserStatus', methods=['GET'])
def update_user_status():
    user_id = request.args.get('id')
    new_status = request.args.get('status')
    # ... logic to update user status directly via GET ...
    return jsonify({'message': 'Status updated'}), 200
```

**Automation Potential:** While backend architecture design is largely a manual review process, adherence to specific sub-rules (like API design, database design) can be partially automated through linters, schema validators, and API testing tools.
