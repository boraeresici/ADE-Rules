- Analyze error messages and logs.
- Check recent code changes.
- Formulate and test hypotheses.
- Add strategic debugging logs.
- Examine variable states.

**Rationale:** The debugging process is an iterative cycle of observation, hypothesis, and experimentation. Thorough analysis of available information and systematic testing of assumptions are key to efficient problem-solving.

**Automation Potential:** Logging frameworks and monitoring tools provide valuable data for analysis.
