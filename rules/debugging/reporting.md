For each issue, provide the following:
- Root cause explanation.
- Evidence supporting the diagnosis.
- Specific code fix.
- Testing approach.
- Prevention recommendations.

**Rationale:** Clear and comprehensive bug reports facilitate collaboration, ensure that issues are fully understood, and help prevent recurrence. Documenting the root cause and prevention strategies contributes to continuous improvement.

**Automation Potential:** Issue tracking systems (e.g., Jira, GitHub Issues) manage bug reports.
