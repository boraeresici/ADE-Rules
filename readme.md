# ADE Rules Project 🚀

Welcome to the **ADE Rules Project**! This repository serves as a comprehensive, structured, and machine-readable collection of best practices and rules for Application Development Environments (ADEs).

Our mission is to empower both human developers and AI-driven development assistants with clear, consistent, and actionable guidelines to foster high-quality, secure, performant, and collaborative software development.

## ✨ Why ADE Rules?

In today's fast-paced development landscape, maintaining code quality, ensuring security, and optimizing performance are paramount. This project addresses these challenges by:

- **Standardizing Development:** Providing a unified set of rules across various technologies and domains.
- **Empowering AI Assistants:** Offering a structured format that AI Development Environments can easily consume and apply.
- **Enhancing Collaboration:** Ensuring all team members adhere to consistent standards, reducing friction and improving code reviews.
- **Promoting Best Practices:** Guiding developers towards proven methods in coding, architecture, security, and operations.

## 📚 Project Structure & Philosophy

Our rules are organized into a modular, granular structure, making them easy to navigate, understand, and integrate into automated workflows. Each rule is designed to be atomic and independently applicable.

### Key Components:

- **Rule Categories:** Rules are grouped into logical directories (e.g., `rules/code-quality/`, `rules/ai-safety-operations/`).
- **Individual Rule Files (`.md`):** Each specific rule is defined in its own Markdown file, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle. These files include:
    - **YAML Frontmatter:** Metadata like `id`, `title`, `description`, `tags`, `severity`, `applies_to`, `automation_potential`, `suggested_tools`, and `related_rules`.
    - **Detailed Content:** Explanations, rationales, good/bad practice examples, and production checklists.
- **Manifest Files (`rules.json`):** Each category contains a `rules.json` file that acts as a manifest, listing all rules within that category with their metadata. This facilitates programmatic access and rule discovery by ADEs and CLIs.
