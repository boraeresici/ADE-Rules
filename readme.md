# ADE Rules Project

Welcome to the ADE Rules project! This repository contains a comprehensive set of rules designed to establish standards for quality, security, performance, and teamwork in software development processes.

Our goal is to provide a structured and modular collection of best practices that can be consumed by both human developers and automated systems like AI Development Environments (ADEs) or Command-Line Interfaces (CLIs).
